i have the below message from the PM, he said you know the codebase adn project technically so he is just guiding
we are supposed to ship v1.3 with payment but before that we have to do something so the payment will be later in v1.4:
```
I get you. You’re right: stop “enter every time.” We need a **persistent LinkedIn-style profile** and then Tailor runs **against saved data**. Here’s the v1.3 UI + data plan, tight and buildable.



# What changes (simple)



1. **Onboarding stepper** after sign-up:

   Profile Basics → Experience → Education → Projects → Skills → Links → Review. Save once.

2. **Main screen** becomes 2 panels:

   Left = Saved Profile (read-only with “Edit”); Right = “Add JD / Paste Link” and **Generate**.

3. **History** tab: past runs, quick re-generate, download ZIP, Overleaf.

4. **Profile completeness meter** drives conversion and quality.



# Profile schema (store once, reuse forever)



```json

{

  "basics": { "full_name":"", "headline":"", "summary":"", "location":"", "email":"", "phone":"", "website":"", "links":[""] },

  "skills": [{ "name":"Python", "level":"expert", "keywords":["FastAPI","Pydantic"] }],

  "experience": [{

    "title":"AI Engineer","company":"BoardAndGo","location":"","start":"2022-01","end":"present",

    "employment_type":"full-time",

    "bullets":["Built multi-agent orchestration...", "Optimized FastAPI services..."]

  }],

  "education": [{ "school":"ALX", "degree":"Certificate, SWE", "start":"2021-01", "end":"2022-01", "gpa":null }],

  "projects": [{ "name":"Resurector","url":"","stack":["FastAPI","Next.js"],"bullets":["Automated tailored resumes..."] }],

  "certifications": [{ "name":"Prompt Engineering", "issuer":"Prof DKB", "date":"2025-05" }],

  "awards": [{ "name":"AI Ignite Finalist","by":"Datamellon","date":"2025-03" }],

  "languages": [{ "name":"English","level":"C2" }],

  "preferences": { "regions":["US","EU","GL"], "templates":["minimal","modern"] }

}

```



Notes: stick close to JSON-Resume concepts so we don’t invent weirdness. Add `updated_at`, `version`.



# JD input (no more retyping profile)



* **Paste JD text** or **Paste job link** (we fetch JD if possible).

* Region select auto-defaults from profile `preferences.regions[0]`.

* “Advanced” toggle: choose template, language, page length.



# Screens (minimal Tailwind build)



* **/onboarding** (Stepper with autosave per section)

* **/app** (tabs: Profile | Generate | History)

* **/app/profile** (edit in sections; show completeness %)

* **/app/generate** (JD textarea + link input, added JDs list, Generate button, live job queue status)

* **/app/history** (list cards: company, title, date, links: resume/cover/pdf/tex/zip, Re-run)



# Components to (re)build



* `ProfileSectionBasics.tsx, ExperienceList.tsx, EducationList.tsx, ProjectsList.tsx, SkillsEditor.tsx, LinksEditor.tsx`

* `JDComposer.tsx` (paste text, paste link, region, add)

* `RunCard.tsx` (artifacts + re-run)

* `CompletenessBar.tsx` (simple % rule: basics 20, experience 40, education 15, projects 10, skills 10, links 5)



# API (keep v1.2 stable; add only what’s needed)



* `GET /api/v1/profile` (return saved profile)

* `PUT /api/v1/profile` (update sections; full replace)

* `POST /api/v1/jd/fetch` { url } → { jd_text, company?, title?, region? }  // best-effort scrape, fall back to manual

* existing `POST /generate` and `/status/:run_id` stay the same (now they just read the stored profile)



# Tailor call (server)



* Use **stored profile** + JD payload → prefilter → LLM → JSON → LaTeX.

* Add **profile version** to runs so future edits don’t break historical outputs.



# Migration (no user pain)



* On first visit post-upgrade, if user has old “ad-hoc profile,” convert it to new schema and drop them into **/onboarding** with sections prefilled.



# Nice touches (fast wins)



* **“Import from resume (PDF/DOCX)”** to prefill profile (resume-parser lib).

* **“Paste LinkedIn JSON export”** option later; scraping their site = TOS risk, don’t do that.

* **Autosave** every field blur.

* **Toasts** for saves/validation errors.



# Exact tickets for Qoder (copy/paste)



1. FE: Add route `/onboarding` with 6 steps; create components listed above; autosave to `PUT /profile`.

2. FE: New `/app` layout with tabs Profile/Generate/History; add `CompletenessBar`.

3. FE: Build `JDComposer` with text+link inputs; call `POST /jd/fetch` when link provided; keep added JDs list.

4. FE: History page consuming existing runs API; add Re-run button that posts same JD again.

5. BE: Add `GET/PUT /profile`; add `profile.version`; store in DB.

6. BE: Add `POST /jd/fetch` stub (allow simple HTML fetch + meta extraction; if blocked, return 400 “paste text”).

7. BE: Modify `/generate` to read profile by `user_id`; persist `profile_version` into run record.

8. BE: Add profile completeness util; expose `GET /me/completeness`.

9. BE: Add minimal resume-parser endpoint (optional): `POST /profile/import` with file upload to prefill basics/experience.



You’re thinking straight. This reduces friction, increases quality, and sets us up for Jobs integration. If you pass this to Qoder, we can keep your backend mostly intact and just add the clean profile model + new screens.
